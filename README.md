# myRoadMapToJava
This is my complete Java programming experience from beginner to expert!

I started to learn Java 12 months ago, but starting Sep 20, I wanted to upload some of my projects that show my progress towards mastering Java, I am uploading some of my old projects, but I don't know if I can find them all so for the ones I can't find I will just make a new quick project demonstrating my skills!

I want to come back to the start of this repo and see how much of a better programmer I become in the next 2 years when I do Software or Computer Engineering!

Lakshmanan Ramanathan!
